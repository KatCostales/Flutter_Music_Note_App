CS-378H Assignment 3

EX03_01 – Set up your GitHub repository, and add Pete as a collaborator. (Pete’s user name is ptucker).

EX03_02 – Break down your application from a high level to some specific parts. The more detail you can give here, the better. Hang on to this document (GitHub?), since it will change throughout the semester.
•	Audio listener
    o	Main feature of application
    o	Listens for pitch (and possibly timing) of notes played on a given instrument
•	Auto transcriber
    o	Records what the listener receives into sheet music 
•	Sheet music editor
    o	Allow user to manually modify and polish auto-transcribed music
•	Flashcards
    o	Show user a note/chord on the music staff for the user to play
    o	Listen for the correct notes played
•	Daily challenges
    o	Way for users to stay engaged with app
    o	Include flashcards (for beginners)
    o	Music writing challenges (for more advanced users)
•	Data storage
    o	Store user’s scores on the server
•	User data
    o	Store user’s account information in 
•	Push notifications
    o	Notify users of new challenges, updates, etc.
•	Offline mode
    o	Allow users to create and modify scores offline and save them on their device until a network becomes available
•	Correct note detection
    o	Given a score, listen to a user playing and determine if they played the right notes or not
•	Instrument calibration
    o	If an instrument is out of tune, allow user to calibrate the app by listening to the pitch of each played note and comparing it to the correct pitch of the             actual note

EX03_03 – Start brainstorming ideas on how to solve the problem you’re working on. No idea is off limits. Once you have enough ideas, come up with a plan to test them (e.g. How will you test? In what order?).

EX03_04 – Do some market research. Find products that contribute to your idea
•	Are there products that are very similar? What do they do well? What can you imagine that is 10x better? Warning – it’s dangerous to say “there’s nothing out there like this.”
•	Are there products that are have overlap? What can you learn from those? How can they contribute to your ideas?

Market Research:

Products that contribute to your idea:
-	Melody Scanner:
Melody Scanner is an app that automatically transcribes music into scores. Though they essentially accomplished what our team strives to accomplish; however, we aim to implement our transcribe tool as a learning instrument software rather than primarily transcribing sheet music. We are aiming to implement instruments such as the piano and guitar to begin with and then further instruments after that. Our final app idea strives to build on what Melody Scanner currently has by implementing a similar user interface to Duolingo.

    

-	Score Cloud
Score Cloud provides similar services by allowing users to store their scores and songs online. Additionally, users are able to share their songs, sync score changes across all devices, and generate scores through a subscription model. 

   

-	MuseScore
Muse Score is a different software that allows users to write, download, and edit sheet music on a user-friendly interface.
